# Replication Material for the Paper "Dynamic CoVaR Modeling"

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The code in this repository generates the results of the simulations and the empirical applications of the working paper
Dimitriadis, T. and Hoga, Y. (2022), Dynamic CoVaR Modeling available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14275).


## Data Availability

We unfortunately do not have the licence to make the data publicly available. 
The code of the empirical applications does of course not work without these files.
We still publish the code to make it available for replication. 
It can be tested with publicly available or simulated data.
We will make sure to submit the original data files as supplementary 
files to a journal in the peer-review process such that referees can replicate our results.
The simulations of course work without any additional files.


## Simulations

The files for the simulations are available in the folder 'simulations'.
The file 'sim_CoCAViaR.R' generates the parameter estimates for the CoCAViaR models in Section 3,
which are saved under 'simulations/data'. 
It is recommended to run the file on a cluster on 20+ kernels.
The file 'sim_CoCAViaR_eval.R' evaluates these results and generates the output in the 'simulations/output' folder.


## Application: CoVaR Forecasting with CoCAViaR Models

The predictions of Section 4 are generated by the file 'application/FC_application_ModelFit.R',
which requires the publicly unavailable financial returns in the file 'data_Assets.rds'.
The file 'application/FC_application_FCEvaluation.R' evaluates these predictions 
and generates the output in the folder 'application/output'.
Finally, the file 'application/FC_application_ModelParameters.R' generates the 
parameter estimates for Table 3.
